    \item Barrel shifters
    \item Timing, hazards
    \item Propagation delays and pulse width
    \item ASM chart design
    \item Testing and reliability
    \item Alternate techniques
    \item Quine-McCluskey algorithm
    \item Espresso algorithm
    \item Synchronous and Asynchronous design
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Catalog Description}
Computer-automated design of digital circuits. Functional specification; structural and
behavioral modeling using hardware description languages; simulation for design verification and
timing analysis; circuit synthesis for FPGA implementation; testing and fault diagnosis.

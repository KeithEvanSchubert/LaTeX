LaTeX class files

Baylorthesis
  Initial work on a Baylor thesis class.  I then discovered math and cs had one, so I stopped working on it.
  
Baylor
  LaTeX class to build schedules.  The schedule follows ADA standards, as well as Baylor standards.  Generates schedules from lists of topics, assignments, and holidays, making it easy to re-arrange sequences.  I have a bunch of pre-set assignment types, or you can make your own. 
  
CSUSB
  A variety of LaTeX classes (schedule, thesis, advising) that I made while at CSUSB.  More for reference, but hopefully others can benefit.
  
KES
  Some specialized customizations I use.
